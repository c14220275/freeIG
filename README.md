# freeIG
freeIG is a web-based local social media application inspired by Instagram. This project was created with the primary intention of me learning Laravel, a powerful PHP framework for web artisans. The development of freeIG was guided by a comprehensive tutorial from freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel, which can be found

in this project i use Laravel Framework 10.48.16 
as of doing this project, the freeCodeCamp's youtube tutorial is 4 years old so the are somethings that are no longer available on the newer version of used software, so i do my best to correct it and find the newest implementation that could work with the software that is use

youre going to need npm and composer while developing this project. 

finnaly ive got to thank the people that create the tutorial its really good. 
ps. for me, the person is speaking and typing too fast for me so i recommend playing the video at 75% speed,  but thats just me :)
