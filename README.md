freeIG is a web-based local social media application inspired by Instagram. This project was created with the primary intention of me learning Laravel. The development of freeIG was guided by a comprehensive tutorial from freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel, which can be found at https://youtu.be/ImtZ5yENzgE?feature=shared

in this project i use Laravel Framework 10.48.16. as of doing this project, the freeCodeCamp's youtube tutorial is 4 years old so the are somethings in the video that are no longer available/work on the newer version of the software, so i do my best to correct or find the newest implementation that could work with the software that's in use.

you're going to need npm and composer while developing this project.

finally ive got to thank the people that create the tutorial it's a really good explaination about the basic and capabilities of laravel.

side note : for me, the person is speaking and typing too fast for me so i recommend playing the video at 75% speed, but thats just me :)

this project is already completed , thankyou :)

All the best, Mike
